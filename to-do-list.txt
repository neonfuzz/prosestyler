Before you do anything else:
    [ ] saaaave the text at each prompt, rather than at the conclusion of the check

Features:
    [ ] provide all suggestions with context
        [X] surrounding sentence
        [X] replace only word shown
        [X] put suggestions in multiple columns if over a certain length
        [X] make word different color in printout (or otherwise highlight)
        [X] option to replace entire sentence
        [X] option for "leave be"
        [ ] help banner explaining what e.g. nominalizations are
    [ ] spell check
        [X] input your own word
        [X] including scientific word list
        [X] add my words to the scientific word list
        [ ] smart quotes --> unsmart quotes
        [ ] SPELL CHECK SHOULD BE RUN ON TOKENS, SO CONTRACTIONS AREN'T FUGGED
        [ ] option to ignore for rest of document
        [ ] option to add to dictionary
    [ ] homophone pointer-outer
        [X] basic checker
        [X] catch "it's"
        [ ] provides example for each homophone
    [ ] passive voice
        [X] basic implementation
        [ ] Catch more complex phrases
    [ ] weak words: use thesaurus on base word, not actual
        e.g. "used" doesn't work well or "be" should show syns for "is"
        AND/OR: can the thesaurus filter by part of speach?
                e.g. "show" is a pain in the butt
                maybe worth using the lemma-thingy instead of the internet one
    [ ] weak words: ignore "have" when used in the perfect tense
    [ ] sentence tense
    [ ] pronouns
    [ ] frequent words (lemmas)
        [X] basic implementation
        [X] distance between frequent words
        [X] interactive
        [ ] bigrams
        [ ] trigrams
    [ ] sentence length and variation
        [X] visualizer
        [ ] function to edit 1+ sentences
        [ ] ask user if they'd like to edit any sentences
    [ ] user experience
        [X] newlines should break sentences
            [X] and stay broken
        [X] 'clean' method to remove "  ", " .", " ," etc.
        [ ] SAVE after each sentence (esp. for re-write things)
            [ ] __init__ will need a save file name.
            [ ] implement
        [ ] ASK users which tests they want to run at start
    [ ] read in from LaTeX
        [X] detex + a little manual interference
        [X] +diff
        [X] +wdiff
        [ ] write an sh script to facilitate workflow


Cleanup:
    [ ] Text class / related scripts should be different from "run" script
    [ ] nominalizations can be generalized more to not use tokens.index(noun)
    [ ] adverbs should find closest verb, not just last one.
    [ ] colors doesn't need 'colorprint' any more.
    [ ] rename colors.py to color.py


Bugs:
    [ ] if you custom-edit a sentence and leave it blank, the program crashes
    [ ] filler words BORKS up if you edit the whole sentence early on
    [ ] grammar check re-asks questions if you later change something in the sentence
    [ ] spelling check should treat possessive "'s" like the base word
    [ ] visualize_length should ignore '\n\n' sentences
    [ ] multiple passive voice / sentence don't get updated in print
    [ ] negatives e.g. "was not included" don't get caught
          also adverbs e.g. "were randomly substituted"
    [ ] adverbs catches things that are not adverbs
          especially with 'not' as part of the phrase
          adverbs shouldn't catch 'al' from 'et. al.'
    [ ] adverbs crashes if you manually modify the context but it's still working on that sentence
    [ ] weak_words catches "motif"
    [ ] weak_words suggests "greater" "larger" "higher" 'round and 'round
    [ ] weak_words highlights the first instance found, not the one we're correcting
    [ ] weak_words should check for part of speech and compare only against the appropriate list, esp. with verbs
    [ ] if suggest receives ## input that is not an option, it should
          have a cleaner resolution than throwing an error
    [ ] most text should use the regular English sentence tokenizer;
        figure out how to train on scientific stuffs
        or just save trained model from science and load that every time.

Long term features:
    [ ] Ability to ignore certain words in certain tests.
    [ ] Don't include "has," "do," and "is" if they are part of tense conjugation (weak_words)

        [X] don't bug about smart quotes

    [X] generalize code that needs generalizing
    [X] proper documentation on everything

Implemented (cleanup):
    [X] Color.print should have a less vague name
    [X] Color object should really just be a module (after rename occurs)
    [X] colors.py needs docstrings
    [X] _replace_one_word should utilize Color.tokenprint
        (replaced with _suggest_toks)
    [X] all methods which use _replace_phrase should get updated
        to _suggest_toks
