Bugs:
    [ ] passive, noms, weak, adv all still use tokens.index()
        (basically anything that relies on tags)
        [ ] highlights the first instance found, not the one we're correcting
    [ ] if suggest receives ## input that is not an option, it should
          have a cleaner resolution than throwing an error
    [ ] most text should use the regular English sentence tokenizer;
        figure out how to train on scientific stuffs
        or just save trained model from science and load that every time.
    [ ] In passive voice, adverbs e.g. "possible suggestions for iswritten" needs to have a space inserted (same w/ adverbs)

Implemented (cleanup):
    [X] Color.print should have a less vague name
    [X] Color object should really just be a module (after rename occurs)
    [X] colors.py needs docstrings
    [X] _replace_one_word should utilize Color.tokenprint
        (replaced with _suggest_toks)
    [X] all methods which use _replace_phrase should get updated
        to _suggest_toks

Implemented (bug fixes):
    [X] weak_words suggests "greater" "larger" "higher" 'round and 'round
    [X] adverbs catches things that are not adverbs
          especially with 'not' as part of the phrase
          adverbs shouldn't catch 'al' from 'et. al.'
    [X] spelling check should treat possessive "'s" like the base word
    [X] "students'" (i.e. plural possessive) isn't tokenized correctly.
    [X] "instructions" should be caught by nominalizations
    [X] visualize_length should ignore '\n\n' sentences
    [X] if you custom-edit a sentence and leave it blank, the program crashes

    [X] thesaurus stopped working? can't ping thesaurus.com
    [X] cliches: "The great fire ball slowly begins to rise in the air and narrow splinters of light pierce the leafy walls of the hut." catches " walls of "??
