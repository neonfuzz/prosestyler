    [ ] adverbs should find closest verb, not just last one.
    [ ] colors doesn't need 'colorprint' any more.

Bugs:
    [ ] if you custom-edit a sentence and leave it blank, the program crashes
    [ ] filler words BORKS up if you edit the whole sentence early on
    [ ] grammar check re-asks questions if you later change something in the sentence
    [ ] adverbs crashes if you manually modify the context but it's still working on that sentence
    [ ] weak_words highlights the first instance found, not the one we're correcting
    [ ] adverbs catches things that are not adverbs
          especially with 'not' as part of the phrase
          adverbs shouldn't catch 'al' from 'et. al.'
          (try googling for 'dependency parser' or similar)
          (http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/corenlp/process)
    [ ] spelling check should treat possessive "'s" like the base word
    [ ] "students'" (i.e. plural possessive) isn't tokenized correctly.
    [ ] visualize_length should ignore '\n\n' sentences
    [ ] if suggest receives ## input that is not an option, it should
          have a cleaner resolution than throwing an error
    [ ] most text should use the regular English sentence tokenizer;
        figure out how to train on scientific stuffs
        or just save trained model from science and load that every time.
    [ ] In passive voice e.g. "possible suggestions for iswritten" needs to have a space inserted
    [ ] passive voice: make a limit on distance between words

Long term features:
    [ ] Ability to ignore certain words in certain tests.
    [ ] Add words to spell-check on-the-fly.
    [ ] Don't include "has," "do," and "is" if they are part of tense conjugation (weak_words)
    [ ] Better interactive edit.
