To ignore default environments like citations, includegraphics, equations, etc.,
you must include \begin{document} and \end{document} tags surrounding text.

run as: detex -s Paper.tex > out.tex

in vim:
    :%s/^\s\+$//
    :%!cat -s
    :%s/\s\+/ /g
    :%s/^\zs\s//

load into a Text() object and then re-save

when comparing, use the tool 'wdiff'
